# Dice Roller

Develop in Swift Tutorials - [Buttons and state: Update the UI with state](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/update-the-ui-with-state#Improve-your-app-design)

## Catchup!

In this tutorial I learned:

1. how to use the @State property wrapper to create reactive data that SwiftUI monitors, automatically updating the User Interface whenever the underlying values change;
1. how to use ForEach to display a dynamic value of dice;
1. and how to set boundaries for the amount of dice in between [1, 5]
